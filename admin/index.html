    When people think of Middle Eastern and North African countries, they often
    think it is a completely different world. And it is to an extent. The climate,
    the culture, the food, and values may be very diffferent from what people in
    the Western world are used to, however there are many misconcieved notions
    of the the countries in this region than are simply not true. Of course the
    best way to clear up these misconceptions would be to actually go to these
    countries. For those who can not make the trip, or who aere hesitant to make
    the trip, this website is for you!
