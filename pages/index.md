  When people think of Middle Eastern and North African countries, they often
  think it is a completely different world. And it is to an extent. The climate,
  the culture, the food, and values may be very different from what people in
  the Western world are used to, however there are many misconceived notions
  of the the countries in this region than are simply not true. Of course the
  best way to clear up these misconceptions would be to actually go to these
  countries. For those who can not make the trip, or who are hesitant to make
  the trip, this website is for you!
