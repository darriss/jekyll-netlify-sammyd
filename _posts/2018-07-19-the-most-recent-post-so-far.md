The Syrian Civil War began in 2011 when people began protesting the Syrian government due to the lack freedom and economic opportunity that was being provided. These uprisings, referred to as the "Arab Spring", had sparked reform in near by countries like Egypt and Tunisia, however the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad (2000-present), led the Syrian government to kill and imprison hundreds of people. This act of mass killing was soon followed by the formation of the Free Syrian Army(FSA), which was a rebel group aimed to overthrow the Syrian government. Once the FSA was formed and other countries got involved, the civil war had begun. Since then about half a million people died, more were arrested and millions have been displaced. This is due to the Syrian government killing and destroying cities, as well as the FSA torturing and killing civilians. This has been ongoing war, that is not guaranteed to stop even if the president is assassinated.

"A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries." -UNHCR

About 11 million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes since the civil war began, making them the largest refugee population in the world. The ongoing killing, violence, torture, arrests, and mass destruction of cities have forced Syrians to seek refuge in a neighbors country, in hopes of returning back their homeland when the war is over. Millions have also been displaced, which means they have left their home but have not crossed an international boarder. In the following interviews, people from different parts of Syria in different circumstances will speak on their choices to leave Syria.
