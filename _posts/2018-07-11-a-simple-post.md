The Syrian Civil War began in 2011 when people began protesting the Syrian government due to the lack freedom and economic opportunity that was being provided. These uprisings, referred to as the "Arab Spring", had sparked reform in near by countries like Egypt and Tunisia, however the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad (2000-present), led the Syrian government to kill and imprison hundreds of people. This act of mass killing was soon followed by the formation of the Free Syrian Army(FSA), which was a rebel group aimed to overthrow the Syrian government. Once the FSA was formed and other countries got involved, the civil war had begun. Since then about half a million people died, more were arrested and millions have been displaced. This is due to the Syrian government killing and destroying cities, as well as the FSA torturing and killing civilians. This has been ongoing war, that is not guaranteed to stop even if the president is assassinated.
